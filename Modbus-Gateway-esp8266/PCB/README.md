# PCB for bridge TCP to RTU via ESP-01 and MAX485.

Fritzing file and gerber zip available.

### 3 versions:

* ESP8266-RS485_DIP -> First PCB design, tested and working (perfect for PZEM-016).

* ESP8266-RS485_DIP-230-> Modified version to be fed directly to 230v, for meters that do not provide 5V power. Tested and working.

* ESP8266-RS485_DIP-V2 -> Reduced version of the first design. Not yet tested, although only the components have been redistributed, it would work perfectly.
